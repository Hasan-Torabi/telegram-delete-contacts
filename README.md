Delete Telegram Contacts Automatically

Telegram currently does not allow users to delete multiple contacts at once on either its mobile app or web version. Users are forced to delete each contact individually, which can be tedious if you have a large contact list. This JavaScript code automates the repetitive task of deleting contacts one by one, simplifying the process.

Why Use This Code?
Many users search for ways to:

Delete multiple contacts on Telegram
Delete all contacts on Telegram
Easily manage and clear Telegram contact lists
This script provides a solution for users who want to clean up their contact lists without manual work. The script simulates a process that opens each contact's profile, selects the edit button, deletes the contact, confirms the deletion, and then moves on to the next contact in the list, repeating the process until all contacts are deleted.

Instructions
To use this script, follow these steps carefully:

Login to Telegram Web:

Go to Telegram Web and log into your account.
Switch to the "Z" Version of Telegram Web:

Make sure you're using the latest "Z" version of Telegram Web (web.telegram.org/k/).
Navigate to Your Contacts List:

Open the Contacts section in Telegram Web.
Open Developer Console:

Press F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows) / Cmd+Opt+I (Mac) to open the Chrome Developer Tools.
Go to the Console tab in Developer Tools.
Run the Script:

Copy the JavaScript code from the file delete-all-telegram-contacts.js.
Paste the code into the Console and press Enter to execute it.
Automated Deletion:

The script will begin to delete each contact. It will:
Select the first contact in the list.
Open the contact's profile.
Click on the edit icon.
Select the delete button and confirm deletion.
This process repeats for every contact in your list until all contacts are deleted.
Important Notes
This script only works in the web version of Telegram and does not affect the mobile or desktop apps.
Make sure you are logged in to your Telegram Web account and have the Contacts list visible in the sidebar.
If you want to stop the process, simply refresh the Telegram Web page.
